# ðŸ§  MemoReflex Bot

Welcome to the MemoReflex Bot! I'm here to help you capture your thoughts and reflections every day.

## How it Works

### 1. Daily Reflection
Each day at **8 PM**, I will remind you to add your self-journal. You can respond with a paragraph or multiple messages until the day ends. Iâ€™ll save everything you send as your journal for the day.

### 2. Retrieve Memories
Want to look back? Retrieve your past memories by providing a particular date or a date range. Iâ€™ll send you a PDF file with the saved journals.

## Commands

1. **To add todayâ€™s reflection:**  
   You can just start typing when prompted or at any time throughout the day!

2. **To retrieve journals by date:**  
   Use the command:  
   `/get_journal DD-MM-YYYY`  
   or for a date range:  
   `/get_journal DD-MM-YYYY DD-MM-YYYY`

3. **To stop the service:**  
   Use the command:  
   `/stop`

## Notifications
The bot will send you a notification at **8 PM** every day to remind you to journal your day.

## Getting Started
